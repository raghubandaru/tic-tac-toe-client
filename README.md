## Realtime TicTacToe

### Motivation

- How about looking beyond Http protocol and CRUD based applications?
- How about building a game and integrating real-time features to it?

Exploring WebSockets is fun and powerful. There are genuine use cases for it to thrive. While exploring WebSockets, I came across a realtime engine called Socket.io that enables bidirectional and event-based communication.

I chose to develop a minimal web app based on Socket.io. Users can create a game or join the game started by someone with
the generated code. Happy playing!

##### User Interface Technical Skills

- User Interface is developed using React.js.
- Real-time communication is setup using Socket.io client.
- React Context API is used for global state management.
- Supports lazy loading and prefetching the components, thus only loading the necessary chunks.
- Styled-components (CSS-in-JS library) is used for styling.
